# Go With Kyro – Solutions Repository

This repository **only** contains the reference implementations for every exercise in the "Go With Kyro" learning series.

Each project lives inside its difficulty-level folder (`fundamentals`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `expert`) and follows the exact same structure as the prompts:

`goal` – a concise solution that satisfies the required goals described in the companion repo.

The actual project descriptions, learning objectives, and step-by-step instructions are hosted in the companion repository:

➡️  **Project prompts:** <https://github.com/kyrokohan/go-with-kyro>

If you are *starting* an exercise, head over to that repo first. Once you have attempted a project on your own, come back here to compare your approach with the provided solutions.

## Using the Solutions

1. Clone this repository alongside `go-with-kyro` so you can easily switch between the prompts and the code.
2. Navigate to the project and difficulty you are working on.
3. Review the code in the `goal` folder to verify your implementation.
4. Compare and experiment—feel free to tweak the code to deepen your understanding.

Happy coding!
